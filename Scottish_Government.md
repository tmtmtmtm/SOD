## Scottish Government
The sections below list open data provision by the Scottish Government and its directorates, agencies, NDPBS etc. The challenges identified around findability in the Feb 2019 review are little changed. 

## News
__Review underway February / March 2020. A work in progress__

There is still an issue with finability of data, with no central portal for open data in the Scottish public sector or even for Scottish Government. Searching the [main Scottish Government website](https://www.gov.scot/) for _open data_ yields 633 results, none of which are links to _data_ on the first four screenfuls, I didn't go deeper than that.  

## The Data
A list of open data resources in the Scottish Government. 

Data is broken into three types - APIs, open data, and linked open data.

| Key     | Definition |
| :------ |:-----------| 
|A|API|
|L|Linked Open Data|
|O|Open Data|

## Main Scottish Government Statisttics Portal
The Scottish Government's Statistics have a very good portal with 286 Data Sets from multiple organisational-providers. This is up by 38 datasets on last year and includes a new organisation: The Care Inspectorate.

 - [The Scottish Spatial Data Infrastructure](http://spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home). This is a metadata repository for Inspire data, but does not publish open data.
- Scottish Indices of Multiple Deprivation: [map](http://simd.scot/2016/#/simd2016/BTTTFTT/9/-4.0000/55.9000/) and Data is on the Statistics Portal mentioned above, specifically[here](https://statistics.gov.scot/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fdata%2Fscottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation)
 - [Spatial Hub](http://www.spatialhub.scot/get-data/) - still has 4 open datasets; __no change on 2019__. And it still has the most annoying pop-up in the whole of the public sector!

## Scottish Government Directorates
According to [this page](https://www.gov.scot/about/how-government-is-run/directorates/) there are forty-three directorates of the Scottish Government, up from thirty-three at the start of 2019. These are listed below. So far it appears that few produce open data. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorates_of_the_Scottish_Government), which counts 42 directorates, groups these into Directorates-General but this grouping is not obvious from the SG site. 

Incidentally, why isn't there Linked Open Data published about the structure of the Scottish Government with unique identifiers and permanent URIs for each? 

Addtitionally, when accessing the 166 Scottish Government data sets (see the URL in the table above), below the Explore bar there are links (depending on the dataset) to various 'concept folders' such as [housing](https://statistics.gov.scot/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fdef%2Fconcept%2Ffolders%2Fthemes%2Fhousing) many of which must surely align with some of the list below (e.g. Housing and Social Justice Directorate) but unpicking which have published Open Data and which have not appears almost impossible at the moment.

### Homecare 
There are three old datasets about homecare (2010-2012) made available [here](https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Health/Data/HomeCare/HSC-Datasets-HCPRF). It took someone who knows about this to find them and let me know about their existence. This is on the old Scottishs Government Website. The new one is [here](https://www.gov.scot/).

The main page is clearly marked at, the foot, "Crown Copyright." However, clicking on that take us to [this page](https://www2.gov.scot/CrownCopyright). "Re-using Crown copyright material. You may use and re-use the information featured on this website (not including logos) free of charge in any format or medium, under the terms of the Open Government Licence."

### Procurement
The Scottish Government supports Open Procurement. You can download bulk notices or use the API to select data. 

You can find the data [here](https://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/NoticeDownload/Download.aspx)

Similarly, you can search the contracts register [on this page](https://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/Contracts/Contracts_Search.aspx?AuthID=AA10482). Each is OGL licensed. 

## Scottish Government Executive Agencies
I tried various ways to find a list of Executive Agencies on the Scottish Goverment website without success. I'd find pages such as this [guide](https://www.gov.scot/publications/public-bodies-in-scotland-guide/) which had no list. 

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_agencies_of_the_Scottish_Government) lists nine executive agencies.
Where the items in the list below are starred, it indicates that they were previosuly found to have some or all of their open data on the Statistics portal, above. Otherwise, I have found no open data for them.

- Accountant in Bankruptcy __*__
- Disclosure Scotland
- Education Scotland
- Historic Environment Scotland __HES__
- Scottish Prison Service
- Scottish Public Pensions Agency
- Social Security Scotland
- Student Awards Agency for Scotland
- Transport Scotland

__HES__ the HES [spatial portal](https://portal.historicenvironment.scot/spatialdownloads) has loads of data but no open licence.
