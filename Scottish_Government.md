## Scottish Government
The sections below list open data provision by the Scottish Government and its directorates, agencies, NDPBS etc. The challenges identified around findability in the Feb 2019 review are little changed. 

## News
__Review underway February / March 2020. A work in progress__

There is still an issue with finability of data, with no central portal for open data in the Scottish public sector or even for Scottish Government. Searching the [main Scottish Government website](https://www.gov.scot/) for _open data_ yields 633 results, none of which are links to _data_ on the first four screenfuls, I didn't go deeper than that.  

## The Data
A list of open data resources in the Scottish Government. 

Data is broken into three types - APIs, open data, and linked open data.

| Key     | Definition |
| :------ |:-----------| 
|A|API|
|L|Linked Open Data|
|O|Open Data|

### Main Scottish Government Statisttics Portal
The Scottish Government's Statistics have a very good portal with 286 Data Sets from multiple organisational-providers. This is up by 38 datasets on last year and includes a new organisation: The Care Inspectorate.

 - [The Scottish Spatial Data Infrastructure](http://spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home). This is a metadata repository for Inspire data, but does not publish open data.
- Scottish Indices of Multiple Deprivation: [map](http://simd.scot/2016/#/simd2016/BTTTFTT/9/-4.0000/55.9000/) and Data is on the Statistics Portal mentioned above, specifically[here](https://statistics.gov.scot/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fdata%2Fscottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation)
 - [Spatial Hub](http://www.spatialhub.scot/get-data/) - still has 4 open datasets; __no change on 2019__. And it still has the most annoying pop-up in the whole of the public sector!

### Scottish Government Directorates
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorates_of_the_Scottish_Government) there are forty-two directorates of the Scottish Government, up from thirty-three at the start of 2019. These are listed below. So far it appears that few produce open data.

Why isn't there Linked Open Data published about the structure of the Scottish Government with unique identifiers and permanent URIs for each? Why do we have to use Wikipedia as a reference source?
